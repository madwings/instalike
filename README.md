I have created three documents that outline the design and architecture.

1. The architecture with all the graphics of the system is in [architecture.svg](architecture.svg)
2. The architecture is explained in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)
3. Explanations how to run the Proof of Concept are located inside [POC.MD](POC.md)
