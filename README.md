I have created three documents that outline the design and architecture.

1. The architecture with all the graphics of the system is in [a relative link](architecture.svg)
2. The architecture is explained in [a relative link](DESIGN.MD)
3. Explanations how to run the Proof of Concept are located inside [a relative link](POC.MD)
